## Section 07 – Mastering Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java

### Topics Covered

This repository contains my exercises and projects developed during the course Java Programming Masterclass on Udemy, taught by Tim Buchalka.

In this section, I practiced essential Java programming concepts related to classes and object-oriented structure, including:

- Creating and using custom classes
- Defining constructors and using constructor overloading
- Initializing objects and using instance fields and methods
- Applying encapsulation:
  - Declaring fields as `private`
  - Providing `getters` and `setters` to control access
  - Validating input in setter methods
- Using `this` keyword for clarity and constructor chaining
- Understanding and applying class composition (has-a relationships)
- Organizing code into logical, modular structures


## Section 08 – Advanced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java

### Topics Covered

In this section, I practiced core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java, including:

- Class creation and encapsulation
- Constructors and constructor overloading
- Inheritance and use of `super` and `this`
- Method overriding
- Composition vs. Inheritance
- Polymorphism (dynamic method resolution)
- Access modifiers and code organization
