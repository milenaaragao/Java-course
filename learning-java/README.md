- Working with Strings and concatenation



## Section 04 – Expressions, Statements & Code Blocks

### Topics Covered

- Difference between expressions and statements
- Code blocks and indentation
- `if-else` conditions and boolean expressions
- Code readability and best practices
- Introduction to `methods` (briefly)



## Section 05 – Control Flow Statements

## Section 07 – Mastering Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java

### Topics Covered

- Creating and using custom classes
- Defining constructors and using constructor overloading
- Initializing objects and using instance fields and methods
- Applying encapsulation:
  - Declaring fields as `private`
  - Providing `getters` and `setters` to control access
  - Validating input in setter methods
- Using `this` keyword for clarity and constructor chaining
- Understanding and applying class composition (has-a relationships)

- Inheritance and use of `super` and `this`
- Method overriding
- Composition vs. Inheritance
- Polymorphism (dynamic method resolution)
- Access modifiers and code organization



## Section 09 – Advanced Arrays in Java: Single and Multi-Dimensional Techniques

### Topics Covered

- Deep dive into single-dimensional arrays and manipulation techniques
- Working with multi-dimensional arrays (2D arrays and beyond)
- Iterating using nested loops
- Common pitfalls with array copying and resizing
- Practical examples using arrays in real-world scenarios



## Section 10 – Mastering Lists, Iterators, and Autoboxing: ArrayList, LinkedList & Enums

### Topics Covered

- ransitioning from arrays to Java’s List interface
- Using ArrayList and LinkedList for dynamic data storage
- Implementing and understanding ListIterator and Iterator
- Autoboxing and unboxing with wrapper classes
- Leveraging Enum types for structured constant values
- Practical applications involving custom object lists



## Section 11 – Mastering Abstraction & Interfaces: Expand Polymorphism & Java Hierarchies

### Topics Covered

- Building abstract classes and abstract methods
- Interfaces: implementing multiple behaviors across class hierarchies
- How polymorphism supports flexible, scalable code
- Class hierarchies and method overriding in depth

## Section 12 – Deep Dive into Java Generics: Bounds, Comparators, and Advanced Techniques

### Topics Covered

- Introduction to generics and type safety
- Declaring generic classes and methods
- Upper and lower bounds (extends, super)
- Implementing and using Comparator and Comparable interfaces
- Generic wildcards and collections
- Advanced use cases and best practices



## Section 13 – Exploring Nested Classes, Local Types, and Anonymous Classes

### Topics Covered

- Static nested classes vs non-static inner classes
- Local classes defined within methods
- Anonymous classes: concise implementations of interfaces/abstract classes
- Use cases in event-driven programming (e.g., UI callbacks, comparators)
- Accessing variables from outer scopes and shadowing
