- The `main()` method and Java entry point
- Printing output with `System.out.println()`
- Basic syntax rules and semicolons
- Writing and running Java code in IntelliJ
- Comments in Java (`//` and `/* */`)



## Section 03 – Variables, Data Types & Operators

### Topics Covered

- Primitive data types: `int`, `double`, `boolean`, `char`, etc.
- Variable naming and initialization
- Arithmetic, relational, and logical operators
- Casting between data types
- Working with Strings and concatenation



## Section 04 – Expressions, Statements & Code Blocks

### Topics Covered

- Difference between expressions and statements
- Code blocks and indentation
- `if-else` conditions and boolean expressions
- Code readability and best practices
- Introduction to `methods` (briefly)



## Section 05 – Control Flow Statements

### Topics Covered

- `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements
- `switch` statements for multiple-choice logic

## Section 06 – Methods in Java

### Topics Covered

- Defining and calling methods
- Method parameters and return types
- Method overloading
- Scope of variables
- Code reusability



## Section 07 – Mastering Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java

### Topics Covered

In this section, I practiced essential Java programming concepts related to classes and object-oriented structure, including:

- Creating and using custom classes
- Defining constructors and using constructor overloading
- Initializing objects and using instance fields and methods
- Applying encapsulation:
  - Declaring fields as `private`
  - Providing `getters` and `setters` to control access
  - Validating input in setter methods
- Using `this` keyword for clarity and constructor chaining
- Understanding and applying class composition (has-a relationships)
- Organizing code into logical, modular structures



## Section 08 – Advanced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java

### Topics Covered

In this section, I practiced core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java, including:

- Class creation and encapsulation
- Constructors and constructor overloading
- Inheritance and use of `super` and `this`
- Method overriding
- Composition vs. Inheritance
- Polymorphism (dynamic method resolution)
- Access modifiers and code organization
